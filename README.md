2019 Â© KKBOX.

**KKCarPlayManager** provides a simple, clear and declarative way to implement
the functionalities of [CarPlay](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/).

## Requirement

- Xcode
- Swift 4.2 or above
- iOS 8.0 or above

## Installation

You can install the package via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.

### CocoaPods

Add `KKCarPlayManager` to your pod file, then run `pod install`.

### Swift Package Manager

Just add `https://github.com/KKBOX/KKCarPlayManager.git` to your `Package.swift`
file, or, you can add the package in Xcode 11 by selecting "File" -> "Swift
Packages" -> "Add Package Dependency".

## Example

The project has an example project. Go to the `Example` folder, run `pod install`,
open `Example.xcworkspace`, build and run the example app.

## Getting Started

Apple does not allow a CarPlay audio app to customize user interface./ You don't
call any method on CarPlay, but let
[MPPlayableContentManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager)
to call you, discover your contents, and list them in a structured table user
interface.

KKCarPlayManager helps you to build your contents into a tree to be discovered.
KKCarPlayManager already implemented the data source and delegate of
MPPlayableContentManager for you, and all you need to do is to give
KKCarPlayManager a root node and its subnodes. For example:

``` swift
// Import required modules.

import KKCarPlayManager
import MediaPlayer
import AVFoundation

// You should set at least one command of MPRemoteCommandCenter, otherwise
// MPPlayableContentManager won't call it data source and delegate.
MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared().playCommand.addTarget { event in
    return .success
}

// Create a root node.
let rooNode = KKStaticContainerItem(identifier: "root", title: "Root", children: [
    KKStaticContainerItem(identifier: "folder1", title: "Folder 1", children: [
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_1_1", title: "Song name", url: "song URL..."),
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_1_2", title: "Song name", url: "song URL..."),
        ]),
    KKStaticContainerItem(identifier: "folder_2", title: "Folder 2", children: [
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_2_1", title: "Song name", url: "song URL..."),
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_2_2", title: "Song name", url: "song URL...")
        ]),
    ]
)

// Create your manager.
manager = KKCarPlayManager(rootNode: rooNode)

// Sets the data source and delegate of MPPlayableContentManager to the manager.
manager?.activate()
```

Actually these nodes are  instances of `KKBasicContentItem`. It is a subclass of
`MPContentItem`, and you can subclass `KKBasicContentItem` for your own need.

## Items/Nodes

We added three methods on `KKBasicContentItem`:

- `KKBasicContentItem.children`: A list of `KKBasicContentItem`.
- `KKBasicContentItem.loadChildren(callback:)`: Ask the item to load its children.
- `KKBasicContentItem.play(callback:)`: Play the item.

There are two kinds of items/nodes, one is containers while another is playable
items.

### Containers

A container could be list a playlist or an album. It has it children. When you
select a container on the CarPlay screen,
`KKBasicContentItem.loadChildren(callback:)` would be called and the CarPlay
screen goes to the next level and present its children items in a table UI.

If you want to load children items from a file or from the Internet, subclass a
KKBasicContentItem, set `isPlayable` to false and `isContainer` to true, do your
loading in `KKBasicContentItem.loadChildren(callback:)` and remember to call the
callback closure.

KKCarPlayManager made a built-in container item type, `KKStaticContainerItem`. You
can just use the class if you have a static list.

### Playable Items

A playable item could be a song track, an audio book and so on. When a playable
item is selected, the `KKBasicContentItem.play(callback:)` method would be
called and your app should start playing. You should create your own subclasses
for playable items in your app, since we are hardly to know how your player
works and creates classes for you.

If there is any error while playing, call the callback closure and pass the
error, otherwise you can pass `nil`.

## A Full CarPlay Experience

When you want to enable CarPlay in your audio app,

- You need to have a valid provision profile/entitlement, otherwise your app
  won't appear on the CarPlay screen. Please contact Apple.
- You need to enable some commands of [MPRemoteCommandCenter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpnowplayinginfocenter), otherwise
  `MPPlayableContentManager` won't call its data source and delegate.
- Enable audio background mode and set the current category of [AVAudioSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession)
  to `.playback`, in order to enable background playabck.
- Set up KKCarPlayManager as we mentioned above.
- Once there are changes in your tree, call `MPPlayableContentManager.shared().beginUpdates()` and
  `MPPlayableContentManager.shared().endUpdates()`.
- Provide now playing information to [MPNowPlayingInfoCenter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpnowplayinginfocenter).

## One More Thing

On Xcode 11, you can use Swift UI like syntax to construct the node after
importing `KKCarPlayManagerExtensions`. For example:

``` swift
let rooNode = KKStaticContainerItem(identifier: "root", title: "Root") {
    KKStaticContainerItem(identifier: "folder1", title: "Folder 1") {
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_1_1", title: "Song name", url: "song URL...")
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_1_2", title: "Song name", url: "song URL...")
    }
    KKStaticContainerItem(identifier: "folder_2", title: "Folder 2") {
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_2_1", title: "Song name", url: "song URL...")
        PlayItem(identifier: "Song_2_2", title: "Song name", url: "song URL...")
    }
}
```

Enjoy! ðŸš—
